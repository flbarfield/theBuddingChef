<h2>Summary</h2>
Built as a tool for a blog, users can search through a database by specific main ingredients in order to obtain a list of recipe options. These recipes can then be searched to obtain ingredients, YouTube videos, photos, and cooking directions on how to create the dish.

---

<h2>Optimizations</h2>

 1. Make the populated recipe list clickable links, instead of having to copy and paste.
 2. Do away with two text boxes for the search, and query both APIs at once with the user's input

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
As simple as it looks, this project is actually one that really sparked a love for software engineering in me! It basically revolves around gathering data that someone else probably spent hours upon hours testing, cooking, and organizing so much food-related data, and that's before even putting it on the internet for public use. So to me, this was a taste of what communities of people could really accomplish, and this tool actually brought a lot of joy to my friends and family members who also got sick of eating the same things over and over!
